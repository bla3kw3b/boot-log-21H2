Boot log for:

- Windows 10 build 19043 (21H1), released May 2021 (latest build), 
- SC 3.12.0 
- scide 
- supernova 
- local server

Actions performed after each log:
- scide closes
- task manager carefully checked & closed
- OS restarts

code for each boot:

```
(
    (
        (
            Server 
        )
        .supernova
    )

    ServerOptions ( )

    .maxSynthDefs_(2 ** 8)

    .maxNodes_(2 ** 10)

    .memSize_(2**18)
)
.boot
```

A successful boot is denoted as active CPU update values in the ide

Task manager is carefully checked after each log... no processes were found

The first log occurs just after a fresh updated build install

Supernova booting
Server: possible boot delay.
On some Windows-based machines, Windows Defender sometimes delays server boot by one minute.
You can add scsynth.exe and/or supernova.exe *processes* to Windows Defender exclusion list to avoid this delay. It's safe.

Successful boot 

For all of the following boot attempts:
- networking is turned off via hardware killswitch


3:```
Booting server 'localhost' on address 127.0.0.1:57110.
Server 'localhost' exited with exit code 1.
```
Failed boot attempt -> Task manager shows no servers -> no attempt made to kill servers

4:
```
Booting server 'localhost' on address 127.0.0.1:57110.
Server 'localhost' exited with exit code 1.
```
Failed boot attempt -> Task manager shows no server -> Server.killAll ran from scide

Networking is still off, switching networking back to on before restart

Networking will remain on for all following boot attempts... 

5: identical to log #2... successful boot

Server was inadvertently booted in process (boot file was evaluated twice ctrl+E)
...failing immeditaley, then -> Server.killAll (ide) -> boot attempt ctrl + e ->
fail -> Server.killAll (ide) -> fail 

Networking is verified to be on... this log highlights a separate but still relevant issue

Battery is almost dead... now carefully checking task manager once more, before performing
complete shutdown.

8:```
/*
This boot log was lost due to unexpected shutdown. 

...now I remember, the initial attempt to boot supernova with the internal 

server after many failed attempts with the local server took a record breaking 55-65 

seconds to boot... the internal server typicallys to boots in 3-8 seconds
*/
```

9:```
/*
This boot log was also lost, I can clearly remember testing scsynth with the local server,

with an exit code 1... 100% confident
*/
```

10: ```
/*
Now returning to boot log after 24 hours... fully charged after unexpected shutdown.

Boot log is written in notepad, not the ide... the former has been in the background for the last 10

-15 minutes, with no other processes being run. Networking has been on the whole time...

...now initiating final boot call using supernova, and the default (local) server
